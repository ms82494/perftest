# perftest
Compares the Python performance in linear algebra/data processing of a 2020 MacBook Air M1 to that of a 2017 Pixelbook and a (much older, self-built) desktop.

Scripts from [this article](https://python-bloggers.com/2021/01/are-the-new-m1-macbooks-any-good-for-data-science-lets-find-out/).

Added a variant of Script 4, which takes advantage of [Intel optimizations for sklearn](https://intelpython.github.io/daal4py/sklearn.html).

Results [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qamci0eEIlPmMUQG3oVRJG2EtNmw7MeNT6ZnbFK8AN8/edit?usp=sharing).
